# TryHackMe_SOC_Simulator
In this project I explored the two updated free scenarios on TryHackMe's SOC simulator, including:

- "Introduction to Phishing"
- "Phishing Unfolding"
<br/>
<br/>


<h2>Platforms and Technologies Used:</h2>

- TryHackMe SOC Simulator
- Splunk
- Windows
<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Introduction to Phishing:</h3>

Immediately when selecting the scenario, there is a prompt to choose a preferred SIEM. In this project I chose Splunk because I had the most experience with that platform.
